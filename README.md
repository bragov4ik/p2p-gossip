# P2P gossip application

## Description
This is an application for creating and connecting to a simple peer to peer network. Nodes in the network periodically ping all other members and receive (and display) others' pings.

## Network behavior and summary
This is a fully-connected network, which means all nodes directly communicate to each other. This allows to simplify ping distribution process, since each peer is responsible only for itself.
